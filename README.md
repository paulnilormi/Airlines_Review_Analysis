# ✈️ Airlines Review Analysis | Power BI Dashboard  


📌 Project Summary

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built using customer review data from 3,788 airline passengers. It focuses on uncovering trends in customer satisfaction, service quality, and recommendation behavior by analyzing numerical ratings and review metadata. 

As a beginner-friendly yet impactful analysis, the sentiment breakdown is based on customer-given ratings — offering a clean, structured foundation for future extensions into NLP-based sentiment work.
